# Halo-Online-Tag-Names
A collection of complete tag lists for various Halo Online and ElDewrito builds

The main idea behind these tag lists is to have an accurate and cohesive list of tag names for various Halo Online builds. Because Halo Online does not use tag names by default, most of the existing builds lack proper tag names, and the builds that do often feature incomplete or inaccurate tag lists. These lists have been carefully created by cross referencing tag names and tag data from various different halo builds in order to ensure that they are as accurate as possible

## How can I use these
Currently there are only complete tag lists for the following Halo Online and ElDewrito builds:

- ElDewrito 0.5.1
- ElDewrito 0.6.1
- ElDewrito 0.7.1
- Halo Online MS23 (1.106708 cert_ms23)

To use these tag lists, you can copy the ```tag_list.csv``` file for the corresponding build into the ```maps``` folder. Doing this should allow tools such as Assembly or TagTool to make use of the tag names. 

If you would like to update the tag list directly or generate the tag list based on available tag indexes in the target build, you can use the ```.json``` files for the corresponding build alongside the ```UpdateTagList``` command in [TagTool-NET-Test](https://github.com/MtnDewIt/TagTool-NET-Test) to generate a new tag list that contains updated tag names.

## Contributing

Any help is very much welcome.
