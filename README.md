# Halo-Online-Tag-Names
A collection of complete tag lists for various Halo Online and ElDewrito builds

The main idea with these tag lists is to have an accurate and cohesive list of tag names for various different Halo Online builds. Due to the fact that Halo Online does not make use of tag names by default, most of the existing Halo Online builds lack proper tag names, and the builds that do often feature incomplete or inaccurate tag lists.
These lists have been carefully created by cross referencing tag names and tag data from various different halo builds in order to ensure that they are as accurate as possible

## How can I use these
Currently there are only complete tag lists for the following Halo Online and ElDewrito builds:

- ElDewrito 0.5.1
- ElDewrito 0.6.1
- ElDewrito 0.7.1
- Halo Online MS23 (1.106708 cert_ms23)

(Currently I only have the tag lists stored JSON, which isn't all that useful. I'll convert them into csv files soon)

## Contributing
If there any issues with any of the tag names in these tag lists, or you have some updated tag names you wish to add, feel free to make a pull request or create an issue.
Any help is very much welcome.
